# FridayNightCheating
A modification that you can put on FridayNightFunkin' to speed up the process a bit...

# HOW THIS WORKS
This uses the pyautogui module to locate the color of the arrows on the screen, once it finds them, it will wait till they are in the ideal position and press the corresponding character!

# NOTICES
Cheating in games isn't fun, this is just for me to learn more about pyautogui, use if you're willing to have your ego/confidence destroyed.

# DEMO MODE
When you first start the application you will be in demo mode, the program will tell you to put your cursor on one of the buttons, for example
Example : "Put your cursor on the left button area!"
When you do this with all 4 of the arrows this program will be ready and specifically modified just for you!
